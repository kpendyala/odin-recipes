    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h3>Do you ever make something and think, DANG! I just made that?! This Creamy Chicken Marsala became an instant favorite with the very first bite. The creamy sauce is made with sweet marsala wine and wow, the flavor is incredible. (Don’t worry because alcohol does burn off during the cooking process and is safe for the kids to eat). All you have to add to it is some heavy cream, garlic, mustard, and voila!
    
    Everything about this meal is SO GOOD. It’s perfect served with roasted root vegetables and a simple Caesar salad. You could also serve it over pasta al limone or your favorite noodles for a filling chicken pasta. My family always requests mashed potatoes, so I know for a fact it’s great with those too! This marsala sauce is perfect over rice too. However you decide to serve it, you are going to love this quick and easy chicken dish! </h3>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Salt and Black Pepper: To season the chicken</li>
        <li>Olive Oil: I prefer to cook with olive oil, but you can use your favorite cooking oil. You could use butter instead.</li>
        <li>Mushrooms: Thinly sliced as evenly as possible so they all cook at the same rate.</li>
        <li>Marsala Wine: The key ingredient! It adds all the body and flavor to the sauce.</li>
        <li>Chicken Broth: To help make the sauce.
            Heavy Whipping Cream: This is what makes this sauce so thick and creamy!</li>
        <li>Ground Mustard: I prefer to use ground mustard, but you could also use a liquid mustard. Or you could leave it out altogether if your family doesn’t like mustard flavor.</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder: To add to the depth of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Parsley: Fresh, for garnish. You could also add fresh thyme as well.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook Chicken: In a large skillet over medium heat add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the pan. Add the chicken and lightly season with salt and pepper. Cook until golden brown and cooked throughout. Remove chicken and set aside on a plate.</li>
        <li>Make Sauce: Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and sauté the mushrooms for 1-2 minutes. Add marsala wine and bring to a boil over medium-high heat for 1-2 minutes. This allows the alcohol to burn out. Add the chicken broth, heavy whipping cream, ground mustard, and garlic powder.</li> 
        <li>Thicken Sauce and Serve: Bring to a boil and reduce heat and simmer for about 10 minutes or until it starts to thicken. Place the cooked chicken back in the sauce and continue to simmer for about 1-2 minutes.</li>

    </ol>
